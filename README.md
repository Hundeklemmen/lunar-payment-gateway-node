### Where to find appKey?
You can find the appKey in your Lunar business account dashboard. Go to Online Payments -> Complete your registration -> App Key


### Where to find merchantId?
*It is recommended that you provide the merchantId in the constructor of the LunarPaymentClient, so the client does not have to fetch it from Lunar every time the client is instantiated.*

Easiest way to retrieve the merchantId is by using the `getMerchant` method. The method will return the merchant object, which contains the merchantId.

```ts
let merchant = await lunarPayment.getMerchant();
console.log("Merchant ID", merchant.id);
```
